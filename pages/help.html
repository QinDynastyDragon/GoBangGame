            <h1>1 Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Gomoku, also called Five in a Row (Chinese: "五子棋"，"五目", 
                etc.), is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally 
                played by two players with Go pieces (black and white stones) 
                on a Go board. 
                <br><br>
                It is played using a 15×15 board, while in the past a 19×19 
                board was standard. The game is known in several countries 
                under different names.
                <br><br>
                Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an 
                empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first 
                player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, 
                vertically, or diagonally. 
            </p>
            <h1>2 First Player Advantage</h1>
            <p>
                It has been proven that the first player can force a win, to 
                mitigate this imbalance, professional games have adopted extra 
                rules. Since 2009, championships have adopted the "swap2"
                opening rule. 
            </p>
            <h1>3 Opening Rules</h1>
            <h2>3.1 Pro</h2>
            <p>
                The Pro opening rule has been previously adopted in
                championships, but was dropped after being deemed too 
                unbalanced.
                <br><br>
                The first player's first stone must be placed in the center of 
                the board. The second player's first stone may be placed 
                anywhere on the board. The first player's second stone must be 
                placed at least three intersections away from the first stone 
                (two empty intersections in between the two stones).
            </p>
            <h2>3.2 Swap2</h2>
            <p>
                The first player places three stones on the board,
                two black and one white. The second player then has
                three options:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>They can choose to play as black</li>
                <li>They can choose to play as white and place a second white 
                    stone</li>
                <li>Or they can place two more stones, one black and one white,
                    and pass the choice of which color to play back to the 
                    first player.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Because the first player doesn't know where the
                second player will place the additional stones if
                they take option 2 or 3, the swap2 opening protocol limits
                excessive studying of a line by only one of the players.
            </p>
            <h1>4 Variants</h1>
            <h2>4.1 Freestyle</h2>

            <h2>4.2 Renju</h2>
            <p>
                It is played on a 15×15 board, with the rules of three and three, 
                four and four, and overlines applied to Black only.

                Renju also makes use of various tournament opening rules, such
                as Soosõrv-8, the current international standard for this
                variant.
            </p>

            <h1>5 Rules</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overlines:</strong> prevent a player from winning if they form a line
                    of 6 or more stones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Three and three:</strong> bans a move that simultaneously forms two
                    open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's
                    stone at either end).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Four and four:</strong> bans a move that simultaneously forms two
                    rows of four stones (open or not).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
